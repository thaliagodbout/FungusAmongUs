# FungusAmongUs
üçÑ A fungus-inspired interactive artwork powered by the ESP32 microcontroller.

Inspired by the subterranean mycorrhizal networks that enable communication within communities of plants and trees, _Fungus Among Us_ playfully explores how we can make visible the hidden, subsurface links that connect us when we‚Äôre apart. By looking at the symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants, we might learn more about the symbiotic relationships we share with each other, how we build connections, and the way that our roots interweave to create new meanings for our interactions.

Four mushrooms sit in separate locations surrounding a mysterious Mycelium object. By touching the capacitive sensors on each mushroom, people separated by distance can connect and interact with each other to build a light display. Using Shiftr, signals from each mushroom‚Äôs capacitive sensors are sent to the central Mycelium object. As the participants touch their mushrooms in different ways, the Mycelium is illuminated from within by an array of LEDs, allowing distributed participants to interact through light as the colours mix and combine to diffuse through the fungal threads. Each participant can observe the Mycelium while they interact with each other through its illuminations, watching as it transforms with each touch and weaves the participants' interactions together to create something new.

Requires 1x ESP32 board loaded with code for the Mycelium, and 4x ESP32 boards loaded with Mushroom code.
